# Expansion-of-real-world-datasets-based-on-generative-adversarial-networks
End-to-end autonomous driving based modeling requires learning massive datasets, in order to expand the dataset we propose an improved utilization of generative adversarial networks thus enabling the expansion of real-world datasets.
